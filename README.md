# weather_dashboard

In this project I was tasked with createing a Weather Dashboard using data accessed for a third party API. This website will take user input to search for the current forecast as well as the forecast for the next five days using information retreived from the API about different weather conditions. This website will also saved the cities searched to local storage for future searches without having to type the city in again.
